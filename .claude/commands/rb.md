description: Use Roslyn Bridge for C# code analysis, symbol lookup, diagnostics, and project operations
---

Activate the roslyn-bridge skill to perform semantic C# code analysis using Roslyn.

This skill provides:
- Code search with semantic understanding
- Symbol and reference lookups
- Project diagnostics (errors/warnings)
- Type hierarchies and implementations
- Call hierarchies
- Project build operations

Use rb.ps1 commands through the skill for accurate C# code analysis instead of text-based searches.
